# SHRIKE_FPGA

![image](./asset/shirke-angle-01.jpg)

Shrike is world's first fully open source FPGA Dev board based on Renesas Forge FPGA SLG47910 and RP2040. 

We at vicharak have kept in mind need of a learner, maker and a hobbyist while designing this art. This dev board will be your stepping stone in the field of FPGA , reconfigurable and heterogenous computing.
