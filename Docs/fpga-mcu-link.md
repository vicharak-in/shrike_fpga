# FPGA MCU LINK 
FPGA MCU  link is a custom communication protocol for the communication between RP2040 and FPGA on our -- board. 
## Mode of Operation 
Simplex 
Half Duplex 
Full Duplex 

## Procedure : 

The FPGA CPU link is a custom protocol made for communication between the Renesas Forge FPGA and RP2040 MCU. 
The protocol is a 6-wire protocol Consisting of one clk, one read/write/ack, and 4 bidirectional data lines. 

## Definitions 

Clk -  The clk is being used to synchronize the complete communication so that we do not need to use any kind of CDC FIFO on the FPGA side the frequency of the clock will match the process frequency of the FPGA and can be generated by FPGA or MCU all the event will take place at the posedge of the clock.


Read/Write- The Read/write signal is another signal used in communication for handshaking. The Read/write Signal (R/W) line will generally pull high. This line will be pulled low by the device that want to send the data. For example, if the MCU wants to send the Data it will Check if the line is high or low. In this case, if the LIne is already low that means the FPGA is sending the data It will wait for the line to be high , once the line is high the MCU will pull the line low and on the next edge of the clock it will start sending the data.

For reading the devices will always be polling and or waiting for the interrupt on the read/write line if the negedge is detected it will know about the availability of data.
