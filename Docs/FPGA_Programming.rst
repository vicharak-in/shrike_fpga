If you have successfully installed the Software its time to move to usage guide.





Usage
-----------

Now that you have successfully installed the IDE let try to create a project with it. 

*We will follow these steps to Create a simple led Blink Project on the FPGA Side of the Board.*

**STEP 1:** Open the Go Configure IDE 

.. image:: ./images/go_configure_startup.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: go_configure_startup_page

**STEP 2:** Move to Develop Tab and open Forge FPGA Workshop Now Double Click on the SLG47910 part in the Menu.

.. image:: ./images/forge_fpga_workshop.png
   :width: 900

**STEP 3:** Now Select the project name and project location of your choice.

   :width: 900

**STEP 4:**  Once you have selected the name and project location you will se the project setting tab selected the project settings as mentioned in the Image below.

   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop


**STEP 5:**  After adding the project settings double click on the project setting in the IDE and you should move to a new tab with a main.v file open. This is you main editor.

.. image:: ./images/main_v.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop


**STEP 6:**  Quick Look at the IDE 
The Go Configure Software Hub is a Complete FPGA Work Flow IDE that handles Project from Design Entry to the FPGA Flashing.

THe few main feature are .

**STEP 7:**  Design Entry We will now write the verilog for blinking the on board Led connected to the FPGAon our Shrike Board. 

.. image:: ./images/code_entry.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop

Here the link Verilog for the Design . Our you can write your custom Led Blink example as well.

There a Few primitive that we would have to take care of while writing Design in our  IDE Unlike other FPGA IDE teh GO COnfigure Software Hub Require us to mention the top module in the verilog itself with a primitive (* top ) , the clock input requires to be defined with primitive (* iopad_external_pin, clkbuf_inhibit*) .

A complete Guide to Design Entry in Go Configure Software hub is linked here It is quite necessary for you to go through this after finish this tutorial for now you can continue with our Verilog 

**STEP 8:**  Simulation The GO configure Software Hub Usage Iverilog with GTKWave for the task of 
Simulation. These Software could be downloaded from here. 




**STEP 9:** Design Synthesis: After Simulation onces the design is working as expected we would need to Synthesize the Design. 
To Synthesize the Design One need to Press the Synthesize Button in the Button Left Corner of the IDE. If your Design get Synthesized Properly you should see a green tick in from front of the Synthesize Button.Otherwise you can check Synthesis Log or Issues tab for error.

.. image:: ./images/synthesize.png

   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop

**STEP 10:**  IO Planning : Onces your Design is Synthesized Properly we need to map our I/O Port to the FPGA I/O . The GO Configure Software Hub Has a simple GUI based IO planner. One need to link the IO port 
to respected pin. 

.. image:: ./images/clk_IO.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop

In our case the led is connected to the Physical pin 18 of FPGA IC so we will Link it to that and we will connect the Clock to the Osc output and we will also need to connect the enable pin for both. 

.. image:: ./images/IO_planner.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop

**STEP 11:**  Bitstream Generation : The Next step in the flow is Bitstream Generation. Onces your IO are mapped Properly you are just one step away from the Bitstream Generation and this button is available just below the Synthesize Button onces pressed a automated flow will start which will do all Placement , Routing and Bitstrem
Generation. If the Bitstream is generated Properly you will see a Green tick in front of Generate Bitstream Button.

.. image:: ./images/bit_stream.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop

Now that your Bitsream is generated properly we have to flash the FPGA with it. 

-----------------------
FLASHING THE Bitsream :
-----------------------

So You have successfully generated the Bigstream for you project Very Good. Now we have to Flash or write that Bitsream to
FPGA (we will continue with the Led_blink example) and we are using RP2040 as a SPI Master to do it. And we have a custom script for it. 

Before moving along with the Flashing part you wold have to setup the MCU (RP2040) Programming Part of the Shrike Board a Guide for that can be found here If You have done it we can move to flashing 

One Need to flow these Step to Flash the Bitsream to FPGA. 

**STEP 1:**  Connect the Board to your Host PC and move to Thonny IDE in Thonny Enable VIEW < Files. 

Now in this view the flies on the upper left side of manager are your host files and the lower left side
are files available on your RP2040 and flash. 

.. image:: ./images/file_view.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop

**STEP 2:** Getting the Bitsream On RP2040 : To flash the bitsream to the FPGA you first need to get the bitsream on to the on board flash. To do so navigate to you project folder in hte view tab of Thonny on in the project 
older move to ffpga/build/bitstream . Here you should see 4 diffrent bitsream available we only need FPGA_bitstrem_MCU.bin file on out RP2040 Now Right click on the file and click uplode. This will uplode your file the RP2040 

.. image:: ./images/uplode.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100
   :alt: forge_fpga_workshop



**STEP 4:**  Now as you have got the Bitsream on the FPGA we just need to flash for that you need to run flash_fpga.py script 
available on you Shrike Board you can also find it HERE. Open the Python script and run it . You should se hte terminal output 
FPGA Flashed onces the Flashing is done.  And you should see on Board LED blinking.  

.. image:: ./images/done.png
   :width: 900
   :scale: 100

One should follow the same step to flash any other bitsream as well.
